/*
Let's play a game on an array! You're standing at index  of an -element array named . From some index  (where ), you can perform one of the following moves:

Move Backward: If cell  exists and contains a , you can walk back to cell .
Move Forward:
If cell  contains a zero, you can walk to cell .
If cell  contains a zero, you can jump to cell .
If you're standing in cell  or the value of , you can walk or jump off the end of the array and win the game.
In other words, you can move from index  to index , , or  as long as the destination index is a cell containing a . If the destination index is greater than , you win the game.

Given  and , complete the function in the editor below so that it returns true if you can win the game (or false if you cannot).
